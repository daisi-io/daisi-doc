# Update a Daisi

When a new version of your code is available to Github,
you can push it to the Daisi platform:

1. Open the *Settings* tab in your Daisi page
2. Click on *Synchronise*. You will be asked to select the branch with which to
make the update.

## Update when the requirements have changed

In the current version of the Daisi Platform, **you will need to delete your
Daisi and recreate it** if the requirements have changed (new version of *requirements.txt*).

## Streamlit apps update

When you push a new version of your code which can render a Streamlit app, the
app should be immediately updated. Just close any browser window where the app
is rendered and re-click on **Launch the app** in the Daisi page.
