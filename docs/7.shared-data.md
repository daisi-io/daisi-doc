# Data store  

The Daisi platform features a Data store.
Currently, it is a public and shared drive.
Support for private folders will be added later on.

You can access the **Shared Data** folder by clicking
on your user profile in the upper right corner.

!!! note
    A personal access token is required for share data access

```python
from pydaisi import SharedDataClient
sd = SharedDataClient()

# load the root directory
folder = sd.Folder("/")

# create new folder relative to folder
new_folder = folder.create("new_folder")

# upload file
sd.upload_file("/shared data/folder/path", "/local/file/path")
sd.put_object("/shared data/folder/path", <object bytes>, "file name")

# download file
sd.download_file("/shared data/file/path", "/local/path")
obj = sd.download_fileobj("/shared data/file/path")

# list contents
folder = sd.Folder("/shared data/folder/path")
for f in folder.list():
    print(f.name)

# delete a file
file = sd.File("/shared data/file/path")
file.delete()

# delete a folder 
folder = sd.Folder("/shared data/folder/path")
folder.delete()
```
