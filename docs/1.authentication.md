# Authentication

An access token is required to execute private daisies on [app.daisi.io](https://app.daisi.io).  
Private Daisies are any Daisies which have not been made "Public".
They can be Daisies that you own and visible only to you or Daisies which have been shared within a team you belong to.  

## Getting an access token

Once you are logged on the platform :   

* click on your account settings (top right) and select **Personal Access Tokens**
* click on **Generate a New Token** and fill in the form (name, expiration date)
* copy the token and store it in a secret file

!!! note

    This is the only time this token will be visible in the platform. 
    The Daisi plateform doesn't store your tokens.   
    You can have multiple tokens. The **Personal Access Tokens** page allows to manage them.

## Authentication

### iPython / Jupyter notebook

In an iPython console or a Jupyter notebook, set the `#!bash DAISI_ACCESS_TOKEN`
environment variable as follow:

```python
import os
os.environ["DAISI_ACCESS_TOKEN"]=<your access token>
```

### Using a shell environment variable

Define a `#!bash DAISI_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.  

In a *sh* type shell (sh, bash, ksh, zsh, ...):  

```bash

export DAISI_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your access token>
```

In a *csh* type shell (csh, tcsh, ...):

```csh

setenv DAISI_ACCESS_TOKEN <your access token>
```

### Using an .env file

Add the following line in a  `#!bash .env` file:

```bash

DAISI_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your access token>
```

Then `#!bash source .env`
